### Hey, are you interested in embedded systems?

If so, I recommand you to join (online only) the [**Live Embedded Event #3**](https://live-embedded-event.com) on May the 18th.

One day of online conferences, workshops or lighting talks about the embedded ecosystem.

Don't hesitate to submit a talk. There are two formats: *long talk* (45 min. + 15 min Q/A) or *short talk* (25 min + 5 min Q/A).
Talks may be given in english or in french.
