### Hey! Are you interested in embedded systems?

If so, I recommand you to join (online only) the [**Live Embedded Event #3**](https://live-embedded-event.com) on **May the 18th**.

One day of online conferences, workshops or lighting talks about the embedded ecosystem.

The list of the speakers (and the subjects of their talks) will be available soon.

(If you want to submit a talk, the Call for Papers is still open for a few days)
